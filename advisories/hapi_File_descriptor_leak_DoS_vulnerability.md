vulnerable_versions: "2.0.x || 2.1.x"
patched_versions: ">= 2.2.x"
...

## Overview:

Versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x have a file descriptor leak that when triggered repeatedly will cause the server to run out of file descriptors and the node process to die. The effort required to take down a server depends on the process file descriptor limit. No other side effects or exploits have been identified.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an attacker to take down a hapi-based server running versions 2.0.x and 2.1.x.

This does NOT affect hapi 1.x deployments.

## Recommendations:

- Please upgrade to version 2.2.x or above as soon as possible.
