cves: "[{\"name\":\"CVE-2015-5688\",\"link\":\"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-5688\"}]"
vulnerable_versions: "<13.0.8"
patched_versions: ">=13.0.8"
...

## Overview:

Geddy static file serving allows directory traversal with a URI encoded path.

### Example
```
http://localhost:4000/..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2f..%2fetc/passwd

geddy is serving the output as it doesn't match the routes and it's a static file
```

## Recommendations:

Update to version >= 13.0.8
