## Overview:

The dns-sync library for node.js allows resolving hostnames in a synchronous fashion

All versions of dns-sync prior to the release 0.1.1 were vulnerable to arbitrary command execution via maliciously formed hostnames.

For example:

    var dnsSync = require('dns-sync');
    console.log(dnsSync.resolve('$(id > /tmp/foo)'));

This is caused by the hostname being passed through a shell as part of a command execution.

## Recommendations:

Updated to version 0.1.1 or greater
