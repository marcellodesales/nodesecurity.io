title: qs Denial-of-Service Extended Event Loop Blocking

## Overview:
The qs module does not have an option or default for specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring.

## Recommendations:
Update qs to version 1.0.0 or greater
